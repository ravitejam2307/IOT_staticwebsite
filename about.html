   <h2>History of IOT</h2>
 <b><p> What is Internet of Things?</p></b>
 <p>The term "Internet of Things" (IOT) was first used in 1999 by British technology pioneer Kevin Ashton to describe a system in which objects in the physical world could be connected to the Internet by sensors. Ashton coined the term to illustrate the power of connecting Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags used in corporate supply chains to the Internet in order to count and track goods without the needs for human intervention. Today, the Internet of Things has become a popular term for describing scenarios in which Internet connectivity and computing capability extend to a variety of objects, devices, sensors, and everyday items.</p>
 <p>While the term "Internet of Things" is relatively new, the concept of combining computers and networks to monitor  and control devices  has been around for decades. By the late 1970's for example systems for remotely monitoring meters ont he electrical grid via telephone lines were already in commerical use. In the 1990's advances in wireless technology allowed "machine-to-machine" (M2M) enterprise and industrial solutions for equipment monitoring and operation to become widespread. Many of these early M2M solutions, however, were based on closed purpose-bulit networks and proprietary or industry-specific standards,15 rather than on Internet Protocol (IP)-based networks and Internet standards.</p>
 <p>Using IP to connect devices other than computers to the Internet is not a new idea. The first Internet "device"-an IP-enabled toaster that could be turned on and off over the Internet was featured at an Internet conference in 1990. Over the next several years, other "things" were IP-enabled, including a soda machine at carnegie Mellon University int he US and a coffee pot in the Trojan Room at the University of Cambridge in the UK (which remained Internet-connected until 2001). From these whimsical beginnings, a robust field of research and development into "smart object networking" helped create the foundation for today's Internet of Things.</p>
 
 <h3><b>IOT - Advantages</b></h3>
 <p> The advantages of IOT span acroos every area of lifestyle and business. Here is a list of some of the advantages that IOT has to offer-</p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Improved Customer Engagement</b>- Current analytics suffer from blind-spots and significant flaws in accuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IOT completely transforms this to achieve richer and more effective engagement with audiences.</li>
 <li><b>Technology Optimization</b>- The same technologies and data which improve the customer experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology. IOT unlocks a world of critical functional and field data.</li>
 <li><b>Reduced Waste</b>- IOT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us superficial insights, but IOT provides real-world information leading to more effective management of resources.</li>
 <li><b>Enhanced Data Collection</b>- Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its design for passive use. IOT breaks it out of those spaces, and places it exactly where humans really want to go analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything.</li>
 <li><b>Cost reduction</b>- The more businesses use IoT devices to streamline operations and increase profitability, the more Internet of Things technologies will be tailored to help those businesses succeed. From cybersecurity to workplace efficiency, IoT devices are already making an impact on companies’ bottom lines.</li>
<li>Maintenance costs can be positively impacted when IoT devices are used with sensors to keep business equipment running at peak efficiency. On-the-fly troubleshooting of office equipment catches problems before they impact staff and employees, saving the hassle and costs of large repairs.</li>
 <li><b>Efficiency and productivity</b>- As we previously mentioned, many of the benefits IoT implementation delivers has knock-on effects—improving your workforce’s productivity means reducing overall labor costs.</li>
 <li>A study by Aruba found that 46% of businesses that adopted IoT strategies experienced efficiency gains, despite the fact that only 29% expected such gains in the first place.</li>
<li><b>Business opportunities</b>- While many businesses strive to access the revenue-producing power of digital services, most lack a cohesive strategy for pursuing this avenue. IoT is a game-changer in this respect, as advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and smart utility grids make it easy for SMBs to collect actionable data needed to provide the value their customers are seeking.</li>
<li>These analytics provide new insights that are not only being utilized to create new business models, but completely redefining traditional industries.</li>
<li><b>Customer experience</b>- While IoT technology has so far mostly influenced back-end processes because of its relatively new presence, today’s IoT has meant that omni-channel strategies have completely upended the way consumers approach their relationships with businesses.</li></ul>


   <h3><b>IOT - Disadvantages</b></h3>
   <p>Though IOT delivers an impressive set of benefits, it also presents a significant set of challenges. Here is alist of some its major issues-</p>
   <ul>
 <li><b>Security</b>- IOT creates an ecosystem of constantly connected devices communicating over networks. The system offers little control despite any security measures. This leaves users exposed to various kinds of attackers.</li>
 <li><b>Privacy</b>- The sophistication of IOT provides substantial personal data in extreme detail without the user's active participation.</li>
 <li><b>Complexity</b>- Some find IOT Systems complicated in terms of design, deployment, and maintenance given their use of multiple technologied and a large set of new enabling technologies.</li>
 <li><b>Flexibility</b>- Many are concerned about the flexibility of an IOT system to integrate easily with another. They worry about finding themselves with several conflicting or locked systems.</li>
 <li><b>Compliance</b>- IOT, like any other technology in the realm of business, must comply with regulations. ITss complexity makes the issues of compliance seem incredibly challenging when many consider standards software compliance a Battle.</li>
 <li>Security and privacy. Keeping the data gathered and transmitted by IoT devices safe is challenging, as they evolve and expand in use.</li>
 <li>Technical complexity.</li>
 <li>Connectivity and power dependence.</li>
 <li>Integration.</li>
 <li>Time-consuming and expensive to implement.</li>
