 <p>The most important features of IOT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active engagement, and small device use. A brief review of these features is given below -</p>
 <ul>
 <li><p><b>AI</b>- IOT essentially makes virtually anything "smart", meaning it enhances every aspect of life with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and networks. This can mean something as simple as enhacing your refrigerator and cabinets to detect when milk and your favorite cereal run low, and to then place an order with your preferred grocer.</p></li>
 <li><p><b>Connectivity</b>- New enabling technologies for networking, and specifically IOT networking, mean networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks can exist on a much smaller and cheaper scale while still being practical. IOT creates these small networks between its system devices.</p></li>
 <li><p><b>Sensors</b>- IOT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments which transform IOT From a standard passive network of devices into an active system capable of real-world integration.</p></li>
 <li><p><b>Enormous scale</b>- Large scale IoT solutions require the highest possible operational efficiency and reliability. Massive IoT has several requirements, to name a few, scalable IoT solution needs to have: Reliable devices that work in difficult conditions and remote places. Low power consuming devices. High-end security.</p></li>
 <li><p><b>Dynamic nature</b>- The state of these devices change dynamically, example sleeping and waking up, connected and/or disconnected as well as the context of devices including temperature, location and speed. In addition to the state of the device, the number of devices also changes dynamically with a person, place and time.</p></li>
 <li><p><b>Heterogeneous</b>- A heterogeneous distributed IoT system is typically made of various sub-systems. It includes resource-constrained nodes and more powerful nodes such as embedded computer or normal computer nodes. We are assuming a distributed IoT system that includes wireless nodes organized into wireless sub-networks.</p></li>
 <li><p><b>Security</b>- IoT security is the act of securing Internet of Things devices and the networks they're connected to. In the business setting, IoT devices include industrial machines, smart energy grids, building automation, plus whatever personal IoT devices employees bring to work.</p></li>
 <li><p><b>Active Engagement</b>- Much of today's interaction with connected technology happens through passive engagement. IOT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product, or service engagement.</p></li>
