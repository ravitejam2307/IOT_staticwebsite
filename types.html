  <li><p><b>Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT)</b>- Consumer IoT (CIoT) refers to the use of IoT for consumer applications and devices. Common CIoT products include smartphones, wearables, smart assistants, home appliances, etc.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Commercial Internet of Things</b>- While CIoT tends to focus on augmenting personal and home environments, Commercial IoT goes a bit further, delivering the benefits of IoT to larger venues. Think: c</p></li>
 <li><p><b>Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)</b>- Industrial IoT (IIoT), is perhaps the most dynamic wing of the IoT industry. Its focus is on augmenting existing industrial systems, making them both more productive and more efficient. IIoT deployments are typically found in large-scale factories and Manufacture plants and are often associated with industries like healthcare, agriculture, automotive, and logistics. manufacturing plants and are often associated with industries like healthcare, agriculture, automotive, and logistics.</p></li>
 <li><p><b>Infrastructure IoT</b>- Infrastructure IoT is concerned with the development of smart infrastructures that incorporate IoT technologies to boost efficiency, cost savings, maintenance, etc. This includes the ability to monitor and control operations of urban and rural infrastructures, such as bridges, railway tracks, and on- and offshore wind farms.</p></li>
 <li><p><b>Internet of Military Things (IoMT)</b>- The last type of IoT is the Internet of Military Things (IoMT), often referred to as Battlefield IoT, the Internet of Battlefield Things, or simply IoBT. IoMT is precisely what it sounds like â€” the use of IoT in military settings and battlefield situations. It is chiefly aimed at increasing situational awareness, bolstering risk assessment, and improving response time</p></li><br>
